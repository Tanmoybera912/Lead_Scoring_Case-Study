# Project Name: Lead Scoring Case Study 

> Summary - X Education is a specialized provider of online courses tailored for professionals. Each day, a considerable number of professionals explore the website to discover the array of courses offered. The courses are strategically marketed on platforms like Google to reach a broader audience. Upon visiting the website, professionals may engage in activities such as browsing courses, filling out course inquiry forms, or watching informative videos. Those who fill out forms and provide contact details are identified as leads. Additionally, the company acquires leads through referrals.Once these leads are obtained, the sales team takes on the task of converting them into customers through various engagement activities such as calls and emails. Despite these efforts, the current conversion rate at X Education is only 30%. Enhancing this conversion rate is a priority for the company's sales strategy and overall business success.

## General Information
X Education is in need of a model that can assess and assign lead scores to each potential customer. These scores will serve as indicators of the likelihood of a lead converting into a paying customer, allowing the company to prioritize leads with higher conversion potential. The CEO has set a goal of achieving an 80% lead conversion rate.In the initial stages, the company acquires numerous leads, but only a fraction of them ultimately become paying customers. To improve lead conversion rates, it is crucial to effectively nurture potential leads. This entails providing them with information about the product and maintaining consistent communication. The mid-stage nurturing process plays a significant role in influencing lead conversion rates positively.
## Conclusions
1) The consistency of evaluation metrics across both the test and train datasets indicates the model's reliable performance across various criteria.

2) Using a threshold value of 0.39, the model secured a sensitivity of approximately 75.19% in the train set and around 76.97% in the test set. Sensitivity, in this context, reflects the model's accuracy in identifying converting leads out of all potential conversion candidates.

3) The CEO's objective was to achieve approximately 80% sensitivity, a target the model almost meets.

In summary, the model exhibits an accuracy of about 77.83%, aligning closely with the study's predetermined objectives. Examine specialization offerings with negative coefficients. Evaluate the landing page submission process to identify potential areas for enhancement.
