# Project Name: Lead Scoring Case Study 

> Summary - X Education specializes in providing online courses to professionals. Every day, numerous professionals visit their website to explore available courses. These courses are marketed across various platforms like Google. Upon visiting the website, these professionals might browse courses, complete a course inquiry form, or watch informational videos. When they fill out a form, providing contact details, they're categorized as leads. Additionally, the company receives leads through referrals. After obtaining these leads, the sales team engages in activities such as calls and emails to convert them into customers. However, the conversion rate at X Education stands at a mere 30%.

## General Information
X Education desires a model that assigns a lead score to each lead. This score indicates the likelihood of conversion, enabling the company to prioritize high-scoring leads. The CEO's target is to achieve an 80% lead conversion rate.In the process, many leads are acquired initially, but only a fraction becomes paying customers. To enhance lead conversion, it's vital to nurture potential leads effectively. This involves educating them about the product and maintaining consistent communication. This mid-stage nurturing can significantly impact lead conversion rates.

## Conclusions
1) The consistency of evaluation metrics across both the test and train datasets indicates the model's reliable performance across various criteria.

2) Using a threshold value of 0.39, the model secured a sensitivity of approximately 75.19% in the train set and around 76.97% in the test set. Sensitivity, in this context, reflects the model's accuracy in identifying converting leads out of all potential conversion candidates.

3) The CEO's objective was to achieve approximately 80% sensitivity, a target the model almost meets.

In summary, the model exhibits an accuracy of about 77.83%, aligning closely with the study's predetermined objectives. Examine specialization offerings with negative coefficients. Evaluate the landing page submission process to identify potential areas for enhancement.
